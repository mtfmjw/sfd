    """Django Group admin with CSV upload and download functionality.

    This admin class provides CSV upload and download capabilities for Django Groups
    with their associated permissions. It allows bulk creation and updating of groups
    through CSV files containing group names and permission details.

    Features:
        - CSV upload support for bulk group creation and permission assignment
        - CSV download for exporting group and permission data
        - Automatic permission lookup and assignment by codename and content type
        - Validation to ensure permissions exist before assignment
        - Bulk operations with transaction safety

    CSV Format:
        Expected CSV columns:
        - Group Name: Name of the group
        - Permission Codename: Permission codename (e.g., 'add_user')
        - App Label: Django app label (e.g., 'auth')
        - Model: Model name (e.g., 'user')

    Upload Behavior:
        - Creates new groups if they don't exist
        - Adds permissions to existing groups (doesn't remove existing permissions)
        - Validates permissions exist before assignment
        - Uses bulk operations for performance
        - Atomic transactions ensure data consistency
