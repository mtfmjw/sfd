    Instead of showing all municipalities in a single large dropdown, users
    first select a prefecture, which then populates the municipality dropdown
    with only relevant options.

    Features:
        - Cascading prefecture/municipality dropdowns
        - Custom form with dynamic field population
        - JavaScript-powered AJAX interactions
        - Maintains all existing functionality (upload, filtering, etc.)

    Attributes:
        form: Custom form class with cascading dropdown functionality
        fields: Form field ordering and organization
        list_display: Columns shown in the admin list view
        list_filter: Available filters in the admin sidebar
        search_fields: Fields searchable from the admin search box
        readonly_fields: Fields that cannot be edited
        upload_type: Type of file upload supported (ZIP)
