## Project Overview

The SFD project is a Django-based web application that provides a comprehensive framework for managing master data with temporal validity periods, user authentication, and multi-language support.

### Key Features

- **Temporal Master Data Management**: Models support validity periods (valid_from/valid_to)
- **Audit Trail**: Automatic tracking of who created/updated records and when
- **Soft Deletion**: Records are never physically deleted, only marked as deleted
- **Optimistic Locking**: Prevents concurrent update conflicts
- **Multi-language Support**: Full internationalization (i18n) with Japanese and English
- **Custom Admin Interface**: Enhanced Django admin with permission controls
- **CSV Import/Export**: Built-in support for bulk data operations
- **PDF Generation**: Support for generating PDF reports
- **Advanced Search**: Postcode and municipality search functionality

### Technology Stack

- **Python**: 3.13+
- **Django**: 5.2.4+
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL/MySQL (production ready)
- **Testing**: pytest with django-pytest
- **Code Quality**: Ruff (linting and formatting)
